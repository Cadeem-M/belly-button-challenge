## Introduction
Belly Button Challenge: https://cadeem-m.github.io/belly-button-challenge/

Through this week's challenge, I aim to provide an interactive app that can be used to visualize data recorded on the microbes that colonize human navels.

## How to use App
Upon visiting the website, you would find the page loaded with Subject number 940 as a demonstration.

</p>

On the left side of the page is a Subject id panel that can be used to select and generate visualizations on the selected sample.

</p>

Once the sample whose want to view is selected, 3 updates should happen. Firstly, the demographic info panel underneath the subject id panel will be updated to reflect the personal information of the selected subject.

</p>

Secondly, the bar chart at center page will be updated to reflect the top 10 bacterias found in that subject.

Finally, a bubble chart will be generated at the bottom of the page to further visualize the distributions of microbes.
